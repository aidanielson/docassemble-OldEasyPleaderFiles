  Today's date is: **${ format_date(today(), format='EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy') }**
  
  The next business (court/working) day after today is: xxxxx
  
  You are giving the other side **${ num_of_days }** **${ court_or_calendar }** to respond, which equates to a deadline of **${ format_date(today() + date_interval(days=num_of_days), format='EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy') }**.
