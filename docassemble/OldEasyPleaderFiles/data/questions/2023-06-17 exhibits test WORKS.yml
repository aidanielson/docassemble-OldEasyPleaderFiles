  **The Exhibit Packager**
subquestion: |
  This packager creates a unified PDF document containing:
  
  * an index page listing all of your exhibits
  * labeled exhibit divider pages for each exhibit, and 
  * all of your documentary exhibits themselves.
  
  **Don't worry about the proper chronological order of the exhibits as you enter them. Once you've entered all of your exhibits, you'll be able to re-order them to your liking, on-the-fly!**

question: The Exhibits
subquestion: |
  For each exhibit, you'll first type the full description of the exhibit as you would introduce it in a declaration or an RJN. If you also give an optional "Short Title," it will be used on the exhibit index and divider pages.

      If you're not ready to upload, EasyPleader will create an exhibit divider page where you can later insert the exhibit itself.

comment: |
  Will want to figure out a way to sort or modify the order of multiple files uploaded to DA in any given exhibit - it appears they don't sort automatically but instead randomize possibly through the browser. Here's what jp said: I don't think the JavaScript plugin has any controls for that. The order in which the files are uploaded may be dictated by the browser. A DAFileList is a DAList so it can be sorted by filename using the .sorted() method. E.g., myfiles.sort(key=lambda y: y.filename). You can also present a list as a table and reorder it: https://docassemble.org/docs/groups.html#reordering
